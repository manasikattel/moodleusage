The data initially consisted of the attributes : Time, User full name, Event context, Component, Event name, Description, Origin and  IP address. 
Time denotes the particular date and time at which a certain event was performed by a user. User full name includes the full name of the user who performed a certain event. Event context denotes the context of the event whether it is course related or related to other contexts like research paper or mini project.
